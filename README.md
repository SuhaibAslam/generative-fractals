# An interactive experiment in generative art based on fractal mathematics

This project features the code behind an installation titled “Naturuled”. Naturuled told a story of the interplay between complexity and simplicity by enabling participants to explore the rules of natural systems. It used the mathematical [Lindenmayer Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system) in combination with participatory art to allow users to modify simple fractal properties; these modifications would lead to real-time changes in the quite complex natural systems that the installation would generate based on user input.

The project combined a digital system (based on an object-oriented approach in **Java/Processing**) and a physical system (based on a **C++/Arduino** microcontroller). Some examples of generated organic-looking images with varying degrees of complexity can be seen in the generated_imgs folder.
